# Lab 01: Enterprise Infrastructure Audit
**Date:** January 2026  
**Status:** Completed  

## 🎯 Objective
To analyze the 2021 Facebook outage from a systems design perspective and identify the specific failure points in their BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) configuration.

## 🛠️ Tools Used
* [Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/) (Traffic Analysis)
* [Draw.io](https://www.drawio.com/) (Network Topology Mapping)
* Linux Terminal

## 🔍 Key Findings
1. **Root Cause:** A routine maintenance command unintentionally disconnected Facebook's data centers from the wider internet.
2. **Cascading Failure:** Because the network was down, internal tools (like badge readers) also failed, delaying physical access to the servers.

## 💡 Lessons Learned
This lab highlighted the danger of **Single Points of Failure**. In the future, I would recommend out-of-band management for critical infrastructure to ensure access during a primary network collapse.
